ThorJS Builder
======

This is a Grunt plugin for building ThorJS (https://github.com/renie/thorJs).

"Build", in this case, means to convert the original Design Pattern of ThorJs
into another one.

So the lib can be made using prototypes extending default Javascript objects (as it is for now),
and be used within an own object, or simple isolated global functions(still not implemented),
or even AMD lib (not implemented yet as well =D).

Can you use this on your lib, just for building?
Today I do not recommend. It`s not very flexible yet.
BUT feel free to fork and help me to make this more generic faster!
